# NLBSE’24 Inference
In this package, we provide various tools to get started on NLBSE’24 inference.
The NLBSE'24 Tool Competition Dataset is a collection of 3,000 labeled issue reports 
extracted from five open-source projects. These issue reports were collected over a 
period of 21 months, from January 2022 to September 2023, ensuring a diverse range of 
issues and scenarios are covered. Each issue report in the dataset is labeled with one
of three categories: bug, feature, or question.
